# Adventure-of-Chi-Hang-final-

This game is called meteor rain and it is an original dialog-based game project. Ihis game is my first game built using Ren'Py. Based on the choices you made throughout the game the ending would be different. It contains original characters and sprites. <br>The language used is Ren'Py and all the effects are built based on it.
